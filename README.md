# Sipros3.1

Sipros is a database searching program for shotgun proteomics. It can perform accurate general-purpose protein identification, broad-range post-translational modification searches, and stable isotope probing. Hybrid MPI/OpenMP parallelism of the new Sipros architecture allows its computation to be scalable from desktops to supercomputers. Sipros was integrated with ProRata for label-free quantification, metabolic labeling quantification, and isobaric chemical labeling quantification (TMT/iTRAQ).
